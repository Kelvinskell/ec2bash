**Ec2bash** is a robust bash script designed to automate to a very large extent, the management of AWS EC2 instances.
Ec2bash streamlines and automates common instance management tasks such as:
- Starting an instance
- Stopping an instance
- Rebooting an Instance
- Terminating an instance

This script also describes your available instances while providing concise output, with a succint summary of instance information.

This script is designed to run in two modes:
- Interactive mode
- Non-interactive mode
These features make it even more robust, dynamic and adaptable to different use cases.
